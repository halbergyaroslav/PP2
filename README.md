## Quiz 1

### Sets

```python
a = set('abracadabra')
b = set('alacazam')

#union or sets
print(a | b)
print(a.union(b))

#intersection of sets
print(a & b)
print(a.intersection(b))
```

### Variable names

Officially, variable names in Python can be any length and can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and the underscore character (_). An additional restriction is that, although a variable name can contain digits, the first character of a variable name cannot be a digit.

```python
#Camel Case
var_name = 'numberOfCollegeGraduates

#Pascal Case 
var_name = 'NumberOfCollegeGraduates'

#Snake Case
var_name = 'number_of_college_graduates'
```
